0,World Wide Stout,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,4.14,Pours a nice rich roasted brown color with a billowing two finger dark tan head that laces the glass well.,American Double,18.00,4.0,3.25
1,Trip In The Woods - Barrel-Aged Islay Fog,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,2.83,"This beer is S-M-O-K-E-Y. The nose is a bit of burnt brakes on hot summertime asphalt. The first taste is smoked meat, tobacco, salt, peat, and caramel. The finish is medium to harsh with a scotch peaty kick in the arse. On the plus side if you give this beer about 30 minutes it mellows out a bit, but not too much. This is the Winston Churchill of beers!",American Strong Ale,8.50,1.75,3.0
2,Fort Point Pale Ale,Trillium Brewing Company,4.49,"16 oz can poured into std pint glass. Hazy medium gold color with light creamy white head which dissipated quickly. Not much lacing to speak of. Nice tropical and citrus fruit nose. Taste follows with nice balance and a well-balanced bitterness in the finish. This not as exciting as some of their other exceptional offerings but outstanding as a ""daily drinker"". Getting to Trillium is hard for me so I have to be selective when there but given the cooler capacity, I would grab 4 whenever I am there.",American Pale Ale (APA),6.60,4.5,4.25
3,Arcadia Cocoa Loco,Arcadia Brewing Company,3.58,"12oz bottle, no date. Pours hazy brownish black with a medium sized tan head. Smells of cocoa, vanilla, hops, and spice; low intensity. The taste follows exactly with lightly roasted malt, cocoa, hops, and spice; very straightforward and lacking richness. Thin body and average carbonation for the style. Overall, this has a fairly weak cocoa profile contrary to the name and lacks intensity in general. There are better stout offerings on the shelf.",American Stout,7.00,3.25,3.25
4,Canoe Country Cream Ale,Northgate Brewing,3.96,"Pours a rich, vibrant amber colour. Smells light, crisp, slightly sweet and malty, cereal malts, faint bitter hops, and earthiness.

8,Peach Double Milkshake IPA,Tired Hands Brewing Company,4.43,"Hazy and golden with a white-ish, creamy head. Woule rate higher for look, but there are some yeast particulates floating at the end. Smells strongly of peach and slight vanilla, barest hint of hops (can't quite put my finger on them, either fruity or citrus). Taste is also peach and vanilla, cream, and a slight bit of alcohol on the end. Almost tastes syrupy. Low-to-moderate carbonation, smooth and creamy.",American Double,9.00,4.5,4.5

The taste follows with roasted malt, molasses, cocoa, earthy hops, dark fruit, and char; below average intensity again but only a little alcohol comes though. Moderate bitterness and dryness with subtle sweetness. Average carbonation and body for the style. Overall, the smell/flavor has a somewhat complex and lightly bitter profile, but really needs more intensity. Worth a try, but don't expect a 'big beer.'",Russian Imperial Stout,9.00,4.0,4.0

Aromas of tart citrus(a Yuzu fruit characteristic), raw grains, wheat, bread and a touch of light floral. Taste goes along with what you would expect from the aroma with a crisp, tart citrus flavor, limes.

Finish is clean with just a bit of lingering tartness and evervessence",Berliner Weissbier,3.80,4.0,4.25
